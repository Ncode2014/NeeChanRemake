### Plan Next To update
>**Planing Fix soon**
- [ ] Fixed Some J*v Website
- [x] Fixed P*rn,netflix & Reddit Soon Fix
```
why fix this because base Host Is outdated And Some Website has been taken by IPO-Chan
so i developer NeechanHost Fix host on my repo self not my base Host on some Repo
and For Adblock And Light Version i cannot guarantee Because On adblock is so difficult to Added
because on older NeeChan Has Some problem like a "google Service problem,Shortlink problem and etc" 
so on adblock version i blocked Third-party ads not google ads,so Hope I can Updated adblocker again
on Light Version I Guarantee On 15 May i uploaded Light version because on light version is so easy to added compared adblock and Normal Version

Beta Version i added After All Of them fixed So I added Beta Version With Raw Host (no ipo-chan sim card,No Ipochan Blocking pure IP website only)
```

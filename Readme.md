### info
```
jadi buat next update 1.3 full release akan late beberapa hari soalnya banyak kegiatan in real life so i guess 2 week i can updated for neechan
```

### Note
```
Neechan Final Releases 1.1
and for info it's actually another host with base bebasid 
so maybe you see the host neechan and bebasid it's the same
but i made neeChan his to Only Android User & maybe someday i made magisk module for that so see to development of neeChan

No forget to support bebasid because without his hardwork we can't access many website because "internet positif" and many things 
CheckOut on BaseHost (on this readme linked) if you want support Bebasid and Keep bebasid alive
```

### Note For New User
- Normal Version = is a New Version from "bebasid" but to some Modification & Removed Some Ip
```
And In Normal version,adblock version or Lightweight Have Bypass Sim Card
so All Version Have no Difference to function
```
- Adblock Version = is a Same Version From normal Version But This have adblock & Redirect Version

- Light Version = is a Lite Version from Normal Version because This Version Only Little host added 
```
And This Version Only Have Populer Host & often used daily

```

- Beta Version = it's a version have tiny modification and still based from "bebasid & New IP from me"
```
so if you have some problem From this version i recommend You to don't used if this version unstable for you

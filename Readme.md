### Note
```
Neechan Final Releases 1.1
and for info it's actually another host with base bebasid 
so maybe you see the host neechan and bebasid it's the same
but i made neeChan his to Only Android User & maybe someday i made magisk module for that so see to development of neeChan

No forget to support bebasid because without his hardwork we can't access many website because "internet positif" and many things 
CheckOut on basehost if you want support Bebasid and Keep bebasid alive
